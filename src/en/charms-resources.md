# Juju Resources

A Juju *resource* is additional content/files that a charm can make use of or
may require in order to run.

There are three ways to examine resources:

 1. Charm resources
 1. Application resources
 1. Unit resources

Each of these will be explained below.

Also see [Developer resources][developer-resources] in the Charm developer
guide.

## Charm resources

These are resources that the charm is defined with. They can be listed with the
`charm-resources` command. This will query the Charm Store by examining the
`metadata.yaml` file of the specified charm. The charm therefore does not need
to have been deployed in order to run the command. A controller is also not
strictly required but may be necessary in the case of private charms where
credentials need to be added for authentication.

For example, to show the resources of the postgresql charm:

```bash
juju charm-resources postgresql
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
Resource  Revision
wal-e     0
```

## Application resources

These are resources that a deployed application is currently using across all
its units and are discoverable with the `resources` command. In contrast to the
`charm-resources` command, this command needs a controller (that it queries) as
well as a deployed charm.

For example, to show the resources of the postgresql application:

```bash
juju resources postgresql
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
[Service]
Resource  Supplied by  Revision
wal-e     charmstore   0
```

An application gains resources, typically by a charm developer, via the
`attach-resource` command:

```bash
juju attach-resource postgresql wal-e=/home/ubuntu/resources/wal-e-upgrade.snap
```

Where the charm's `metadata.yaml` file contains the following stanza:

```no-highlight
"resources":
  "wal-e":
    "type": "file"
    "filename": "wal-e.snap"
    "description": "WAL-E Snap Package"
```

## Unit resources

These are the resources that an individual unit (of an application) is
currently using.

For example, to list the resources of unit 'postgresql/0':

```bash
juju resources postgresql/0
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
No resources to display.
```

Above we see the case where there is an absence of active resources at the unit
level.
