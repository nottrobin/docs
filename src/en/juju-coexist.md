# Running multiple versions of Juju

You may wish to use the new 2.x series of Juju releases for new projects, 
tests and development work, but still require to support legacy deployments
which were built on and use the 1.x version of Juju.

Juju 2.x has been designed to be able to co-exist with earlier versions, so
you can install both. The details vary depending on your OS, as detailed
below:

## Ubuntu 16.04LTS (Xenial) and later releases

Running 

```bash
apt install juju
```

...will install the latest Juju 2.x. If you also want to run the legacy
1.x series, you may install that separately:

```bash
apt install juju-1.25
```
**OR**, if you wish to run Juju 1.x as the 'primary' Juju (i.e. the version
the `juju` command points to by default), you can install this package:

```bash
apt install juju-1-default
```

(Juju 2.x will be available by running the `juju-2.0` command).



### Data directories

The 1.x series keeps data in `~/.juju`
The 2.x series keeps data in `~/.local/share/juju/`

You can alter these by setting the environment variables `JUJU_HOME` and
`JUJU_DATA` respectively. **DO NOT** co-locate the files in these
directories or unfortunate things will happen.


## Ubuntu 14.04LTS (Trusty)

Both series 1.x and 2.x can co-exist in Trusty. If you have already 
installed and used 1.x and subsequently install 2.0, the binary for
2.0 will be installed at `/usr/lib/juju-2.0/bin/juju`

You can replicate the experience for Ubuntu 16.04 by using the 
`ùpdate-alternatives` command to add 2.x as an alternative for
the binary to call when issuing the `juju` command, and to add a
`juju-1` command for the 1.x series:

```bash
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/juju juju /usr/lib/juju-2.0/bin/juju 1
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/juju-1 juju-1 /usr/lib/juju-1.25.6/bin/juju 0
update-alternatives --config juju
```

This last command will present a choice for which version to use for 
the `juju` command.

### Data directories

The 1.x series keeps data in `~/.juju`
The 2.x series keeps data in `~/.local/share/juju/`

You can alter these by setting the environment variables `JUJU_HOME` and
`JUJU_DATA` respectively. **DO NOT** co-locate the files in these 
directories or unfortunate things will happen.


## Other Linux 

The CentOS download [here][install] includes the binaries for Juju which
should also work on other flavours of Linux. As these tarballs simply 
contain an executable binary, you can place them wherever you wish, renaming
them if required.

It is recommended to install them in `/usr/lib/juju-1.25/bin/` and 
`/usr/lib/juju-2.0/bin`. After which you can also use `ùpdate-alternatives`
to configure which one to use:

```
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/juju juju /usr/lib/juju-2.0/bin/juju 1
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/juju juju /usr/lib/juju-1.25/bin/juju 0
update-alternatives --config juju
```

The same data directories as noted above for Ubuntu are created on first
use of the Juju binary.

## Windows

The latest Windows version of Juju can be downloaded from [here][install].

Unlike Linux and OS X binary releases, the Microsoft Windows version of Juju is
bundled within an executable installer. Running this will walk you through a
GPL licence agreement, a request for an install location and the opportunity to
add this install location to your environment path. 

By default, a new installation will upgrade any previous installation. If you
wish to install two versions alongside one another, such as versions 1.25 and
2.0, you will need to install the first package without specifying an
environment path. This will stop the second installation automatically
overwriting the first. You can then specify a different install location for
the second installation and either manually rename and add the binaries to
your Windows environment path, or run each executable directly from their
respective directories.

Juju can be uninstalled from the Windows 'Add or remove programs' system pane,
just like any other Windows application.

## MacOS

The Apple OS X download, available [here][install], includes the binaries
for Juju.  These will work work with any recent version of Mac OS X, including
10.9 (Mavericks), 10.10 (Yosemite), 10.11 (El Capitan) and 10.12 (Sierra).

As the download tarball contains executable binaries, you can place them
wherever you wish within your user's shell path (such as `/usr/bin`), renaming
them or their parent folders if required. Renaming is particularly useful if
you want to install two versions of Juju alongside one another, such as
versions 1.25 and 2.0, as the binary files within each archive have identical
names. 

Unfortunately, OS X doesn't currently support a system similar to
'update-alternatives' (see above), which means you'll need to manually update
and name the files differently when installing and using multiple versions.
