# Managing Juju

Distinct from deploying and managing Juju Charms, there are many Juju commands 
which deal with the management of Juju itself, covering actions from disabling
certain commands to enabling high availability for the Juju controller.

These topics are covered in the pages listed under this topic in the navigation 
menu on the left.
