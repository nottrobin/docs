# Installing Ceph

Here we present one way to install a rudimentary Ceph cluster with Juju backed
by an AWS cloud. See [Ceph documentation][upstream-ceph-documentation] to find
out more about Ceph.

Below, we install three Ceph monitors and three OSD systems. Each OSD system
has two 32 GiB OSDs and one 8 GiB volume dedicated to the OSD journal. All
volumes are EBS-based and magnetic (i.e. not SSD).

```bash
juju deploy -n 3 ceph-mon
juju deploy -n 3 ceph-osd --storage osd-devices=ebs,32G,2 --storage osd-journals=ebs,8G,1
juju add-relation ceph-mon ceph-osd
```

This will take a while. Presented below is the final output to the `juju status`
command for a model called 'ceph':

```

Now view the status of the cluster from Ceph itself by running the `ceph status`
command on one of the monitors:

```bash
juju ssh ceph-mon/0 sudo ceph status
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight

            202 MB used, 191 GB / 191 GB avail
                  64 active+clean
```

This tells us that there are six OSDs, 191 GiB of available space, and all
Placement Groups are 'active+clean'.

Now list the storage from Juju:

```bash
juju list-storage
```

Output:

```no-highlight

ceph-osd/2  osd-journals/8  block  ebs   vol-0236aed9919b0ec8e  8.0GiB  attached
```

Here we see each Ceph OSD unit has two OSD volumes and one journal volume, for
a total of nine volumes.

This Ceph cluster is used as a basis for some examples provided in
[Using Juju Storage][charms-storage].
