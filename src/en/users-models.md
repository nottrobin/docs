# Users and models

This section is about understanding models with multiple users.

## Adding models

When an administrator adds a model, by default, the cloud credentials used
throughout the model will be those that the admin used to create the controller
and the SSH keys copied across the model will be those of the controller model.
The administrator can override these defaults with the appropriate command
options.

The model creator becomes, by default, the model owner. However, the creation
process does allow for owner designation.

Examples:

Add model 'mymodel' (in the current controller):

```bash
juju add-model mymodel
```

Add model 'mymodel' and designate user 'tron' as the owner:

```bash
juju add-model --owner=tron mymodel
```

See [Adding a model][addmodel] for details on adding models.


## Models and user access

An administrator can use the `grant` command to grant a user 'read', 'write',
or 'admin' access to any model. 

- `read`: A user can view the state of a model with the `models`,
  `machines` and `status` commands.
- `write`: In addition to 'read' abilities, a user can modify/configure models.
- `admin`: In addition to 'write' abilities, a user can backup models and
  connect to machines via the `juju ssh` command.

To give 'bob' read-only access to the model 'mymodel', for example, the
administrator would enter the following:

```bash
juju grant bob read mymodel
```

To give 'jim' write access to the same model, the administrator would use the
following:

```bash
juju grant jim write mymodel 
```
See [Users][regularusers] for details on available commands.

[note]
Each user has control over naming the models they own. This means it is
possible for two users, `jane` and `claire`, to each have a model with the same
name, `foo`. This could cause difficulty when `claire` needs to access `jane`'s
model. Because of this, it is possible to refer to models using
`{owner}/{model}` in place of just the model name. For example, `claire` can
get the status of the model using `juju status -m jane/foo`.
[/note]

## Controller access

A controller is a special kind of model that acts as the management node for
each cloud environment. Properly managed access to any controller is critical
to the security and stability of your cloud and all its models. 

In addition to the two levels of user access for models, three further levels
of access are used to manage access to Juju's controllers:

- `login`: the standard access level for any user, enabling them
  to connect to a cloud and access any permitted models.
- `add-model`: in addition to login access, a user is also be permitted
  to add and remove new models.
- `superuser`: grants a user the same permissions as an administrator and complete
  control over the deployed environment. 

The `grant` syntax for controller access is the same as model
access, only without the need to specify a model. With no controller specified,
the current controller will be assumed the target:

```bash
juju grant jim add-model
```

A controller can be specified using the `--controller` argument followed by the
name of the controller:

```bash
juju grant jim add-model --controller admin-lxd
```

The `users` command can be used to list all users registered to a controller, along
with their access levels. The output will look similar to the following:

<!-- JUJUVERSION: 2.0.1-xenial-amd64 -->
<!-- JUJUCOMMAND: juju users -->
```no-highlight
Controller: admin-lxd

Name    Display name  Access     Date created  Last connection
admin*  admin         superuser  2016-11-14    just now
bob                   login      1 hour ago    58 minutes ago
jim                   add-model  2016-11-14    58 minutes ago
```

### Controller access for external users

It is possible to give a user access to a controller without creating a local
account for them. Linking the controller to the external identity manager, such
as the Ubuntu SSO, in this way provides the benefit of convenience, as the
authentication system used may also be used for other systems. This reduces
the number of login credentials that users must remember across multiple systems.

To do this, these criteria must first be met:

- The user must already have an account on an external identity manager
- The controller must have been created (bootstrapped) using the identity
  configuration option, like here where we use the URL for the Ubuntu SSO
  and Juju: `--config identity-url=https://api.jujucharms.com/identity`
- The user must first log in to http://jujucharms.com at least once before
  attempting to log in to Juju as an external user
- The user must install Juju on the machine from which they will access the
  controller

On the controller, you grant Frances access to add models using:

```bash
juju grant frances@external addmodel
```

[note]
The '@external' is required as it indicates where the credential
comes from, as opposed to '@local'.
[/note]

You can allow anyone with an Ubuntu SSO account to create models on this
controller like this:

```bash
juju grant everyone@external addmodel
```

Sharing controller information must be done directly between the controller
owner and the external user, such as via email, and manually adding the
controller information to the local user's `$HOME/.local/share/juju/controllers.yaml`
in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions and the similar location in other OSes.

The external user will log in from their machine with `juju login -u <username>`.
They will be directed to the URL for the external identity provider so that
they may log in there and then will be granted access to the controller.

For the external user to create models from the controller, they must have
credentials for that provider, for example, GCE or AWS. Any models created
by this user will use these credentials.

```bash
juju add-model test --credential gce
```

To learn more about credentials, see [credentials].

## Public controllers

The `juju login` command can also be used to access a public controller, using
either the name or the host name of the controller as a parameter:

```bash 
juju login jaas
```

The above command will add the 'jaas' public controller to the list of
controllers you can use, caching its details in the locally stored
`controllers.yaml` file. 

Public controllers will normally use an external identity provider.
[JAAS][jaas], as used above, uses [Ubuntu SSO][sso], which means you should 
register with [https://jujucharms.com/login](https://jujucharms.com/login).

## Revoke access rights

The 'revoke' command is used to remove a user's access to either a model or a
controller. To revoke 'add-model' controller access for user 'jim', you would
use the following:

```bash
juju revoke jim add-model
```

After a `revoke` command has been issued, a user's access will reduce to the
next lower access level. With the above example, user 'jim' would have have
'add-model' access reduced to 'login' access on the controller. This also means
that if a user has write access to a model, the following command would revoke
both read and write access:

```bash
juju revoke bob read mymodel
```

[note]
The admin user has credentials stored in the controller and will be able to
perform functions on any model. However, a regular user who has been given
'add-model' permissions may need to specify which credential to use when
logging in to a model for the first time. To specify a credential, run 'juju
add-credential'.
